Programming Paradigms - Style of Programming
Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm 
— a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs 
— that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.” — Wikipedia
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”
-which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.” — Wikipedia
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. 
-Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.” — Wikipedia


OOP 
- Think about what it does(methods) and what it has (attributes) 
-The class the the blueprint 
- Can generate many objects from the blueprint(class)
