LAMBDA
-small anonymous function
-Many arguments but one expression 
-lambda arguments :expression 
-e.g x = lambda a:a +10, x= lambdar a,b : a*b
- better used when you use as an anonymous function inside another function 

Example 1
-def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
mydoubler = myfunc(2)


ARRAYS 
-Arrays : list of variables that can hold more than one value at a time 
-Can use lists as arrays 
-Need to import NumPy to work with arrays in python
-cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
-cars[0] is the first array item 
-Looping through arrays 
  for x in cars:
    print(x)  #remember identation matters 
-Array methods : append(), clear(), copy(), count(),extend(), index(), insert(), pop(), remove(), reverse(), sort() 

CLASSES/OBJECTS
-Almost everything is an object: has properties and methods 
-A class is an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating object 
-Class 
  class MyClass: 
    x=5
  p1=MyClass()   # creating an object named p1 
  print(p1.x)
-All classes have a built in function: __init__() which is executed when the class is initiated 
-The init function is used to assign values to object properties or other operations necessary to do when the object is created 
  class Person:    #creating a class named Person
    def __init__(self, name, age): #use init function to assign values such as name and age 
      self.name = name
      self.age = age

   p1 = Person("John", 36)
Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
-The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
-The self parameter can be named anything but has to be the first parameter.
-Class definitions can not be empty 

INHERITANCE
-A class inherits all the methods and properties from anotehr class 
-Parent/Base class - The class being inherited from 
-Child/Derived Class - The class inherting from another clss 
-Any class  can be a parent class so syntac is the same
  class Student(Person):  #student is the Parent & Person is the child
    pass 
-When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.Instead teh new function will override the parent function.
-Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
   class Student(Person):
     def __init__(self, fname, lname):
     super().__init__(fname, lname)
